#### Main Take-away: Created a template for my portfolio in order to update as I progress through the bootcamp.

### Goals for this project:
    -From scratch, create a portfolio to showcase my work throughout this bootcamp
    -Include advanced CSS features to showcase what I have learned so far

### What I did:
    -I structured my HTML page in a way that was logical and easy to apply CSS code to.
    -I then applied CSS using tools that we have learned in class.

### What I learned:
    While putting together this portfolio, I have learned a couple important points. A good foundation is key to starting out a project so that minimal adjustments have to be made to it later on.  I also learned alot about CSS. This is a language of infinate possibilities and thus provides limitless options. This is both exciting and frustrating to a new coder! But mostly exciting to see the myriad options to learn.
